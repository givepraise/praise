### Unlock the full potential of your community with reputation scores, rewards and deep insights.

Praise is a community intelligence system that promotes active participation and collaboration through peer recognition and rewards. We help communities become more intelligent, productive and inclusive by providing a simple way for community members to acknowledge, praise and reward each otherâ€™s contributions.

## How does it work

```
/praise @vitalik.eth for "inventing Ethereum"
```

Community members interact with a Discord Praise bot to acknowledge each other's contributions. This bottom-up approach to value recognition keeps the community engaged and invested. Praise can recognize any contribution, big or small, and even those made outside of any platform. This improves cooperation and promotes a more positive and productive community.
